1. Executable Malware: Containing collected executable files. 

GitHub rejects direct uploads of EXE files for some cases, especially malware samples like G0010 Turla and G0080 Cobalt Group due to automated security scans detecting potential threats rather than just size limits. Zipping helps bypass this by evading initial detection, though double compression adds unnecessary overhead. 

G0045 menuPass, the original file size is 63,366 bytes, but GitHub doesn't allow uploads over its limits. I want to avoid double compression, yet I had to do it because the file size was large.
